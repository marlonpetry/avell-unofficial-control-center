## Installation

### The easy way, using `pip3`

Install via pip using sudo or with root user:

```bash

sudo pip3 install avell-unofficial-control-center

```

### The manual way, using `git`

- Clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/rodgomesc/avell-unofficial-control-center.git`), or update with `git pull` if cloned previously.
- Build an installable package: `python3 setup.py build`
- Install the package: `sudo python3 setup.py install`

```bash
aucc -H pink teal -b 4
```

Use `-H` for horizontal rows of alternating colors.
Use `-V` for vertical columns of alternating colors.

### step 1:

create `aucc.service` in `/etc/systemd/system`

```bash
vi /etc/systemd/system/aucc.service
```

### step 2:

press i to enter in vim edit mode and paste folow (use the command in "ExecStart" line to specify aucc options):

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Avell Keyboard Configuration
[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/aucc -c red -b 1
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

to write and save the content press `ESC` and hold `Shift+zz`

### step 3:

give permissions enable service and put it to work:

```bash
chmod 755 aucc.service # give permissions
systemctl enable aucc.service # enable service
systemctl daemon-reload # reload daemon for apply changes
systemctl start aucc.service # start service
systemctl status aucc.service #check status
```

reboot and enjoy :)

if you want to change something in service file don't forget to reload the daemon and restart service:

```bash

systemctl restart aucc.service
```
